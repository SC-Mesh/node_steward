# Node Steward Setup Playbook

## Description
An [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/getting_started/introduction.html) playbook that exists to simplify configuring Raspberry Pi Zero 2W single-board computers running Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS to be able to serve as "node stewards". Node stewards are designed to be deployed alongside Meshtastic nodes to allow them to be more easily remotely administrated by way of being able to run a wide array of supporting software and making updating the firmware installed on nodes more reliable.
